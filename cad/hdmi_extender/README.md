These are braces to mount devices (e.g. the Ethernet switch) that I'm using in conjunction with the Intercom system
inside a Eurobox that also stores the cables, beltpacks, headsets and power sockets.

It will probably not be useful to anyone else but for me it's an important part of this project
and needs to be stored alongside it.
